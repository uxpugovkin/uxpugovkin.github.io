# Konstantin P — portfolio

A static site built from the **habibi** design library. No build step and no dependencies: upload the files and it works.

## Upload to GitHub Pages

1. Create a public repository named `your-username.github.io`.
2. **Add file → Upload files**, then drag in everything from this folder. `index.html` must be at the top level.
   `.nojekyll` is a hidden file. If your computer hides it, the site still works without it.
3. **Settings → Pages →** Deploy from a branch → `main` / `(root)` → Save.

After a minute the site is live at `https://your-username.github.io`.

## What's where

```
index.html               Storefront (home)
sbertech/, ma-direct/,   one folder per case study (header: title, role, tags)
raiffeisen-bank/, t-bank/
404.html                 "page not found"
assets/css/tokens.css    habibi tokens: colours (4 themes), radius, type, shadows, fonts
assets/css/site.css      layout and components; uses tokens only
assets/js/config.js      name, role, menu: edit this to change the menu
assets/js/site.js        renders the sidebar and runs the mobile bar scroll behaviour
assets/img/              logo favicon, empty-state image
assets/fonts/            IBM Plex Mono for habibi Code styles (OFL licence)
```

## Add a case study

1. Copy the `t-bank/` folder and rename the copy, e.g. `new-project/`.
2. In `new-project/index.html`, change `data-page="t-bank"` to `new-project` and update the `<title>`.
3. Add one line to `assets/js/config.js`:
   `{ id: "new-project", title: "New Project", href: "new-project/", icon: "doc" }`

The menu on every page updates automatically.

## Case study sections

Each section is a `<section class="case-section">` with an `h2` title and a text paragraph.
The numbers (01, 02, …) are added automatically in order and are hidden on mobile, so you can add,
remove or reorder sections without renumbering anything.

## Images

Wide images go in a `<figure class="media">` block. It fills the content area up to **1140px**
(text stays at 728px), keeps each image's proportions and shrinks on smaller screens.
Export each image at 2160px wide and add a 1140px copy, both as `.webp`:
`assets/img/<page>/<name>-2160.webp` and `<name>-1140.webp`. Retina screens get the large file,
others the small one, and clicking an image opens it full size.

Wrap every image in `<span class="image-loader">` (add `image-loader--spinner` for large ones).
While it loads, it shows the habibi skeleton pulse (and loader), sized to the image so nothing jumps.
Always write an `alt` that says what the image shows.

## Cards

The three-card block (green / blue / red) is a `<section class="cards">`. It sits side by side
up to 1140px wide and stacks into one column when the block is narrower than 700px.
Card colours come from habibi tokens: `card` (green), `card--blue`, `card--red`.

## Buttons

`.button` is the habibi **button** with every variant. Set the same properties as in Figma:

| Attribute | Values | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `data-appearance` | `default`, `accent`, `danger`, `white` | `default` |
| `data-mode` | `primary`, `secondary`, `ghost` | `primary` |
| `data-size` | `s` (28px), `m` (36px) | `s` |

Hover and pressed states are automatic; add `disabled` (on a `<button>`) or `aria-disabled="true"`
for the disabled state. An optional start icon goes first as `<svg class="button__icon">`:

```html
<a class="button" data-appearance="white" data-mode="primary" data-size="s" href="…">
  <svg class="button__icon" …>…</svg>
  <span class="button__label">Explore my Figma</span>
</a>
```

The button styles in `site.css` are generated from the habibi library's variant table,
so colours always come from tokens and follow day and night.

## Day & night

The site follows the visitor's system setting: **olive** by day and **olive-night** by night, the two habibi colour modes used in Figma.
All four habibi themes are in `tokens.css`. To force one, add `data-theme="olive"`, `"olive-night"`, `"light"` or `"dark"` to `<html>`.
The same attribute on any element pins just that block to a theme, like a fixed variable mode on a Figma frame. The closing banner uses `data-theme="olive"` so its White button stays white at night, over a picture that is dark in both themes.

## Right-to-left

Layout uses logical properties, so `dir="rtl"` on `<html>` mirrors everything, matching the RTL variants in Figma.

## Analytics

Visits are counted with [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com) (cookieless, no banner needed).
Every page has this line just before `</head>`; new case studies copied from an existing folder keep it:

```html
<script data-goatcounter="https://uxpugovkin.goatcounter.com/count" async src="//gc.zgo.at/count.js"></script>
```

Stats live at https://uxpugovkin.goatcounter.com.

Clicks on important links are counted as GoatCounter events: add `data-goatcounter-click="event-name"`
(and optionally `data-goatcounter-title`) to the link. The Sberbank "Explore my Figma" button is counted as
`explore-figma-sbertech`.

## Updating tokens

`tokens.css` mirrors the habibi-library variables and styles. When the library changes, regenerate it from Figma instead of editing values by hand.
